==================

Simple html5 Drag and Drop with Angular

This is just taking the directive I wrote for https://github.com/ericduran/chromeHAR

This is an extremely simple directive.

It does almost nothing for you. Except allow you to use the following directives:

```js

/**
 * Angular Simple Drag and Drop Event.
 *
 * @example <div dnd-dragstart="blah($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-drag="foo($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-dragenter="bar($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-dragleave="blah($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-dragover="foo($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-drop="bar($event)">
 * @example <div dnd-dragend="bar($event)">
 */
```

Thats all.
